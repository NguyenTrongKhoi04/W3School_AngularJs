/**
 * Step 1. Getting Started:
      Start by making an application called myShoppingList, and add a controller named myCtrl to it.
      The controller adds an array named products to the current $scope.
      In the HTML, we use the ng-repeat directive to display a list using the items in the array.
 */
</script>

<div ng-app="myShoppingList" ng-controller="myCtrl">
  <ul>
    <li ng-repeat="x in products">{{x}}</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>So far we have made an HTML list based on the items of an array.</p>
